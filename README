ndn-lighting v2.7
##################

Version history:

1.0 - 2010  - 3.2011 	early c version, triggered lights
2.0 - 4.2011-10.2011 	python overhaul w/ PyCCN
2.5 - 10.2011-5.2012	continued operational refinement, performance tests
2.7 - 11.2012			basic 'example' version w/ DMX

next up (11.2012 & beyond):

another lighting instance (red team / honeypot)
elliptic curve signing (on controller - 4x faster)
HMAC support (hundreds of times faster - only avail currently via ccnx patch)
unified driver (DMX, artnet, kinet)
RGBAW 16-bit lighting control of ColorBlaze fixtures in TV1 (currently they're all 8 bit)

Organization:
#############

/old/ 
	old C stuff is great for reference, but has deprecated as we've focused on python.

/python 
	is where the current TV1 build is.
	
/python/example
	is a basic example, start here if new to this project

/python/perfTest
	is the performance tests, methodology, and past results
	
/lights	
	are the lighting drivers, used for controlling LEDs from NDN
	(mostly Kinet, but also includes the new DMX controller (not used in TV1 but for local testing & potential app box deployment)

/scripts 
	a collection of scripts used on the various platforms to automate things. 
	most are on gumstix/lighting controller
	however the 'web*' scripts run on a web server (currently borges) to support TV1 control
	
/web
	is the 'upload analyze generate' and 'control' web applications 
	(image analysis and lighting sequence generation is legacy from first installation 5.2011 - yet code still works to drive tv1)
	meanwhile the controller part is very useful:
